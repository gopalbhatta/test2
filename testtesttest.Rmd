##Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r, echo = TRUE}
getwd()
setwd("G:/Data Science Course Materials/Reproducible Research/wk2/New Folder")
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
str(data)
summary(data)
```

##Mean total number of steps taken 
```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Number of steps taken per day
steps.date <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = data, FUN = sum)
steps.date
# Histogram of total number of steps taken
hist(steps.date$steps,col="orange",breaks = 20, xlab="Total Steps per Day", 
     ylab="Frequency", main="Histogram of Total Steps taken per day", ylim = c(0, 15))
# Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
mean(steps.date$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
median(steps.date$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
```
Mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day are very close (10766 and 10765 steps, respectively).

##Average daily activity pattern
A time series plot (type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken averaged across all days (y-axis).
```{r, echo = TRUE}
steps.interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = data, FUN = mean)
plot(steps.interval, type = "l")
#Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
steps.interval[which.max(steps.interval$steps), ]
```
Interval "835" contains on average the maximum number of steps (206 steps).

##Imputing missing values
Total number of missing values in the dataset amounts to 2304 (that is almost 13 % of total observations).
```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Total number of missing values in the dataset
sum(is.na(data))
# Strategy to impute missing values - all missing values are filled in with mean value for that 5-minute interval
# Replace each missing value with the mean value of its 5-minute interval
fill.value <- function(steps, interval) {
  filled <- NA
  if (!is.na(steps)) 
    filled <- c(steps) else filled <- (steps.interval[steps.interval$interval == interval, "steps"])
    return(filled)
}
filled.data <- data
filled.data$steps <- mapply(fill.value, filled.data$steps, filled.data$interval)
```
##Preparing plot after computing missing data
```{r, echo = TRUE}
steps.date <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = filled.data, FUN = sum)
hist(steps.date$steps, col="orange",breaks = 20, xlab="Total Steps per Day", 
     ylab="Frequency", main="Histogram of Total Steps taken per day inc NAs", ylim =c(0, 20))
#mean and median after computing missing values
mean(steps.date$steps)
median(steps.date$steps)
```
Imputing missing values, mean of the total number of steps taken per day remains the same while median marginally and now equals to the mean,compared to estimates from the first part (ingoring missing values).

##Differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends
Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels -- "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
```{r, echo = TRUE}
DayGrp <- function(date) {
  if (weekdays(as.Date(date)) %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday")) {
    "Weekend"
  } else {
    "Weekday"
  }
}
filled.data$DayGrp <- as.factor(sapply(filled.data$date, DayGrp))

library(lattice)

steps.type <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + DayGrp, filled.data, mean)
#Plotting the patterns between weekdays and weekend
xyplot(steps ~ interval | DayGrp, data=steps.type, layout=c(2,1), type='l', main = "Average number of steps taken in the weekdays and Weekend")
```
